**OpenGL Terrain Generation Program**

This OpenGL terrain generation program creates dynamic landscapes using tessellation and fog effects to optimize rendering and enhance realism. Each time the program is launched, a new map is algorithmically generated, providing users with unique environments to explore.
Features

    Algorithmic terrain generation
    Tessellation for detailed landscapes
    Fog effects to enhance realism and optimize rendering
    Dynamic map generation on program start

Requirements

    OpenGL compatible graphics card
    OpenGL libraries
    C++ compiler (if building from source)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/malz414/terrain.git

    Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler.

    Run the executable.

Usage

    Upon launching the program, a new terrain map will be generated.
    Use the mouse and keyboard to navigate the terrain.
    Experiment with different settings and parameters to customize the terrain generation process.
    Press [ESC] to exit the program.
